# covid19-precondition-analysis

SARS-CoV-2, a novel corona virus which causes COVID-19, the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Until today (August 1st, 2020), the virus has infected over 18 millions, and claimed the life of nearly 700,000 people. The pandemic not only caused the biggest health crisis of the 21st century so far, but it also triggered a global economic recession. Til this day we still know very little about this virus but how it transmits, we already know that old people and people with pre-existing condition(s) are the most vulnerable demographic, but there are little studies conducted to quantify risks associate with a specific age or condition. This project tries to quantify and estimate risks associate with a certain conditions and age groups.
